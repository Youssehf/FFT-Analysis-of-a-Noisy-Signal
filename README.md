## 📊 FFT Analysis of a Noisy Signal

A simple Python-based signal processing project that simulates a noisy signal composed of two sine waves (50 Hz and 120 Hz), and applies a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to analyze its frequency content.

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries

Python 3.x

NumPy

Matplotlib

SciPy

## 🧠 What This Project Demonstrates

How to generate a composite sine wave signal in the time domain

How to add Gaussian noise to simulate real-world conditions

How to apply FFT to convert the signal to the frequency domain

How to visualize both time and frequency domain data

## 📁 Files
fft_signal_analysis.py — Main Python script containing signal generation, FFT computation, and visualization

README.md — Project overview and setup instructions

## 📷 Sample Output

## ▶️ How to Run
Clone the repo or download the script

Install dependencies (if needed):
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy

Run the script:
python fft_signal_analysis.py

## 📌 Notes
This project serves as a sample of my Python and signal processing skills and was prepared as part of an internship application. It's designed to demonstrate an understanding of basic time-frequency analysis techniques and visualization in Python.
